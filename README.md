# Python_Data_Analysis
Python Project for Data Analysis- Exploratory Data Analysis | Data Analyst Project
This project is an analysis of e-commerce sales data. The goal was to take a raw dataset and use Python to clean it, explore it, and find useful insights. By digging into the data, I was able to identify top-performing products, understand customer behavior across different groups (like age and gender), and get a better picture of overall sales trends. The findings from this project can help a business make smarter decisions about inventory, marketing, and improving the customer experience.

**Key Project Steps**

Setup: The project was set up in a Jupyter Notebook environment, using essential libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
Data Loading & Initial Analysis: The raw dataset was loaded and quickly analyzed using functions like .head(), .shape, .describe(), and .info() to get a first look at the data's structure and contents.
Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned by handling missing or irrelevant information
Columns with too many empty values were removed using the .drop() function.
Any remaining empty rows were removed using the .dropna() function to ensure the data was complete and reliable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I used various data visualization techniques to explore the data and find insights.
I created bar charts and plots to understand how sales are distributed across different age groups, genders, and states.
I also identified the best-selling product categories to help with inventory planning and demand forecasting.

Skills Demonstrated

Data Cleaning: Removing null values, dropping unnecessary columns.
Data Manipulation: Grouping data and sorting values using Pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Python to discover patterns and trends.
Data Visualization: Creating clear and informative plots and charts with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
